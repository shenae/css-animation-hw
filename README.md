## CSS Animations Homework
Refer back to this morning's lesson repo: [CSS Animations Lesson](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-jeopardy/css-animation) for reference.

### Setup && Deliverable
***Homework is due at 11pm tonight***

1. As always, `Fork` and `Clone` this repo.
2. `cd` into your cloned `dir`.
3. Each exercise has its own directory with starter code. There's `html`, `css`, and `js` files where you'll be writing in.
4. Remember to `add`, `commit`, `push` your work frequently. Now `git` working! ;)
5. *Submit a `Pull Request` so we can give you credit for your hard work!*


### ðŸ’¥ 1. Modal Window
1. Open the `modal_window` in your text editor.
2. Follow the instructions in your `main.css` file
3. Write your pseudo code for the close and open buttons
4. Write your JavaScript

### ðŸ’¥ 2. Sidebar Menu
1. Open the `sidebar_menu` in your text editor.
2. Turn and Talk: Chat through how to tackle this interaction with a partner
3. Follow the instructions in `main.css` to make the menu interactive. One step will require writing JS
4. BONUS: Also move the `.content` section over when the hamburger icon is clicked.

### ðŸ’¥ 3. Sticky Nav
1. Open the `sticky_nav` in your text editor.
2. Review these links: [find out how far down the page the nav is](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7778580/how-to-find-the-vertical-distance-from-top-in-px-of-an-element-using-jquery) and [find out how far the user has scrolled](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1283040/how-can-you-use-jquery-measure-how-far-down-the-user-has-scrolled).
3. Write pseudo code in `main.js`
4. Follow the instructions in `main.css` to make the sticky nav functional.
5. Bonus: Fade in the annotations. Bonus: use `setTimeout` (Google it) to stagger the animations.
